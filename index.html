                <ul>
                    <li><strong>23rd June 1912</strong> - Alan Mathison Turing is born in Maida Vale, London, England</li>
                    <li><strong>1931</strong> - After being privately educated he entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics</li>
                    <li><strong>1934</strong> - Moved to New Jersey, USA to study for a Ph.D in Mathematical Logic at Princeton University</li>
                    <li><strong>1938</strong> - Returned to England and joined the Government Code & Cypher School (GC&CS)</li>
                    <li><strong>1939</strong> - At the outbreak of war with Germany Turing moved to the GC&CS headquarters in Bletchley Park, where his work was key in accelerating the breaking of German cyphers.
                        Within weeks of his arrival he had laid specification for an electromechanical machine called “the bombe”, which became instrumental in breaking the German Enigma code.<br>
                        He went on to make five major cryptanalytical advances during the war</li>
                    <li><strong>1945</strong> - Designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) - one of the first designs for an electric stored-program all-purpose digital computer</li>
                    <li><strong>1946</strong> - Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by King George VI</li>
                    <li><strong>1950</strong> - Proposed the “Turing test”. Initially known as the imitation game, the Turing test determines whether a computer can "think"</li>
                    <li><strong>1952</strong> - Convicted of "gross indecency" (homosexuality) and sentenced to 12 months of hormone "therapy" AKA chemical castration.<br> The treatment made Turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form</li>
                    <li><strong>8th June 1954</strong> - Alan Turing was found dead by his housekeeper. He was 41 years old. 
                        The cause of death remains controversial, and although an inquest recorded a verdict of suicide, it is often attributed to the chemical castration.  
                        Other theories include cyanide poisoning, either from suicide via a cyanide-laced half-eaten apple found beside  him, or from his accidentally inhaling fumes from his laboratory. Another possibility is that he was murdered by the secret services during a time when being gay was deemed a threat to national security
                        </li>
                    <li><strong>2009</strong> - Then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official apology, calling his treatment “appalling”</li>
                    <li><strong>2013</strong> - Granted a posthumous pardon by the Queen</li>
                    <li><strong>2019</strong> - Voted by the public as “Greatest Person of the 20th Century” on the finale of the BBC icons series</li>
                    <li><strong>23rd June 2021</strong> - Due to appear on the £50 note on what would have been his 109th birthday</li>
